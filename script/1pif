=head1 NAME

1pif - Read 1Password Interchange Format exports, interactively

=head1 VERSION

version 0.1.0

=head1 EXAMPLE

Run within a 1Password Interchange Format export directory (I<caution>, it
is B<NOT> encrypted).

   shell$ 1pif
   1password> help
   Available commands:
   * quit (also: q, .q)
      exit the program immediately, exit code is 0
   * exit [code] (also: e)
      exit the program immediately, can accept optional exit code
   * file [filename] (also: f)
      set the filename to use for taking data (default: 'data1.pif')
   * types (also: ts)
      show available types and possible aliases
   * type [wanted] (also: t, use, u)
      get current default type or set it to wanted. It is possible to
      reset the default type by setting type "*" (no quotes)
   * list [type] (also: l)
      get a list for the current set type. By default no type is set
      and the list includes all elements, otherwise it is filtered
      by the wanted type.
      If type parameter is provided, work on specified type instead
      of default one.
   * print [ <id> ] (also: p)
      show record by provided id (look for ids with the list command).
      It is also possible to specify the type, in which case the id
      is interpreted in the context of the specific type.
   * search <query-string> (also: s)
      search for the query-string, literally. Looks for a substring in
      the YAML rendition of each record that is equal to the query-string,
      case-insensitively. If a type is set, the search is restricted to
      that type.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program allows you to look into a 1Password Interchange Format
directory exported (again, beware it is B<NOT> encrypted!). When you run
it inside a such directory, it will read the relevant C<data.1pif> file to
get the list of all records, and allow you to browse through it.

The only real command you have to know is C<help>, as it will provide you
all details on the available commands. See L</EXAMPLE> for an... example.

To get a list of records, use the C<list> command (abbreviate it to C<l>).

   1password> list
   passwords.Password
        1 Foo
        2 Bar
        ...
   securenotes.SecureNote
        5 Whatever
        6 Hello all...
        ...
   ...

You will notice that each record is associated to a numeric identifier,
that will be the same through the whole session.

1Password assignes a type to each record. You can see which types are
available in your export through command C<types> (abbreviated C<ts>).

   1password> types
   <*>                         * (accept any type)
                            card (also: cards wallet.financial.CreditCard)
                            form (also: forms webforms.WebForm)
                         license (also: licenses wallet.computer.License)
                            note (also: notes securenotes.SecureNote)
                               p (also: password passwords passwords.Password)
                system.Tombstone
           system.folder.Regular
       system.folder.SavedSearch

If you only want to work with a specific type with the C<list> or C<search>
commands, you can set the desired type with command C<type> (abbreviated C<t>).

   1password> type passwords
   1password> list
        1 Foo
        2 Bar
        ...

The C<search> (abbreviated C<s>) command does a literal search through a YAML
rendition of each record. It's like using Perl's function C<index>, so there
is no regular expressions magic, apart that the search is performed without
caring for the case.

   1password> search foo
        1 Foo

When you want to look at a specific record, use command C<print> (abbreviated
C<p>) with the numeric identifier of the record you're interested into:

   1password> print 1
   ---
   _id: 1
   contentsHash: f87f3cd8
   createdAt: 1234567890
   location: 'Service or Application Name'
   locationKey: 'service or application name'
   secureContents:
     password: you-wish
   securityLevel: SL5
   title: Foo
   typeName: passwords.Password
   updatedAt: 1234567890
   uuid: FD7E562E94D447DCB8F3C3825F8471D9

All the fields you see come from the 1Password export, except for C<_id> that
is added by C<1pif>.

To exit from the program, you can use either command C<quit> (abbreviated with
C<q> or, if you use SQLite, also C<.q>) or command C<exit> (abbreviated C<e>),
in which case you can also pass an exit return code.

On GitHub you can find a few projects for dealing directly with the
original, I<encrypted> version of the 1Password database. For example, you

=head1 NAME

App::OnePif - Read 1Password Interchange Format exports

=head1 VERSION

This document describes App::OnePif version {{[ version ]}}.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use App::OnePif;
   App::OnePif->run(@ARGV);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements an application to allow you to read 1Password
Interchange Format exports interactively and get info out of them.

Before you go on, remember that C<1pif> export directories are
I<unencrypted>. This means that they are I<not secure>. Look in section
L</SEE ALSO> for some projects that work directly on the encrypted
database.

Unless you want to fiddle with the module itself, you are probably
interested into program C<1pif>.

=head1 METHODS

All C<do_*> methods are actually tied to commands available in the
interactive shell. There are also some aliases set in L</run_interactive>.

=head2 DEFAULT_types

=head2 attachments_for
